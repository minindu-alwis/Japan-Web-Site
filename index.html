                            Ashikaga shogunates and a century of warring states, Japan was unified in 1600 by the
                            Tokugawa shogunate, which implemented an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, a United

                            The first human inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago have been traced to the Paleolithic,
                            around 38–39,000 years ago.[1] The Jōmon period, named after its cord-marked pottery, was
                            followed by the Yayoi period in the first millennium BC when new inventions were introduced
                            from Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in
                            the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD.

                            Around the 3rd century BC, the Yayoi people from the continent immigrated to the Japanese
                            archipelago and introduced iron technology and agricultural civilization.[2] Because they
                            had an agricultural civilization, the population of the Yayoi began to grow rapidly and
                            ultimately overwhelmed the Jōmon people, natives of the Japanese archipelago who were
                            hunter-gatherers.[3] Between the fourth and ninth centuries,
                            Portugal and Japan came into contact in 1543, when the Portuguese became the first Europeans
                            to reach Japan by landing in the southern archipelago. They had a significant impact on
                            Japan, even in this initial limited interaction, introducing firearms to Japanese warfare.
                            The American Perry Expedition in 1853–54 more completely ended Japan's seclusion; this

                            Over the following centuries, the power of the imperial house decreased, passing first to
                            great clans of civilian aristocrats — most notably the Fujiwara — and then to the military
                            clans and their armies of samurai. The Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoritomo emerged
                            victorious from the Genpei War of 1180–85, defeating their rival military clan, the Taira.
                            After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in Kamakura and took the title of shōgun.
                            In 1274 and 1281, the Kamakura shogunate withstood two Mongol invasions, but in 1333 it was
                            toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the Muromachi period. During this
                            period, regional warlords called daimyō grew in power at the expense of the shōgun.
                            Eventually, Japan descended into a period of civil war. Over the course of the late 16th
                            century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the prominent daimyō Oda Nobunaga and
                            his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Toyotomi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu came to
                            power and was appointed shōgun by the emperor. The Tokugawa shogunate, which governed from
                            Edo (modern Tokyo), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the Edo period
                            (1600–1868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a strict class system on Japanese society and
                            cut off almost all contact with the outside world.
                            Portugal and Japan came into contact in 1543, when the Portuguese became the first Europeans
                            to reach Japan by landing in the southern archipelago. They had a significant impact on
                            Japan, even in this initial limited interaction, introducing firearms to Japanese warfare.
                            The American Perry Expedition in 1853–54 more completely ended Japan's seclusion; this
                            contributed to the fall of the shogunate and the return of power to the emperor during the
                            Boshin War in 1868. The new national leadership of the following Meiji era (1868–1912)

                            Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. A great
                            power and the only Asian member of the G7, Japan has constitutionally renounced its right to
                            declare war, but maintains one of the world's strongest militaries. A highly developed
                            country with one of the world's largest economies, Japan is a global leader in science and
                            technology and the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries. It has one of the
                            world's highest life expectancies, though it is undergoing a population decline. Japan's
                            culture is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular

                            During the 17th century, a third of the world’s silver was produced in the small town of
                            Omori. The mines were closed down in the 1920s but the surrounding area, dubbed “Iwami
                            Ginzan Silver Mine and its Cultural Landscape” was registered with UNESCO in 2007.

                            Take a relaxing stroll down Omori street past merchant houses from the 1500s that have been
                            converted into cozy cafes. Visiting the perfectly preserved streets and narrow pathway of
                            Ryugenji Mabu Mineshaft will transport you back to Japan’s bygone era of simpler
                            times.You’ve definitely seen the red torii gate of Itsukushima Shrine floating angelically
                            on the ocean if you’ve ever Googled images of Japan. The shrine is located on the tiny
                            island of Miyajima, a 10-minute ferry ride away from the mainland of southern Hiroshima
                            Prefecture.

                            Snap a perfect picture of the grand torii at high tide when it appears to be floating, or
                            walk right up and touch it during low tide. With its hypnotic otherworldly atmosphere at
                            dusk, it’s no wonder the gate is considered the pathway between the human and spirit realm.

                            The theme of nature is predominant throughout these sites. Visit the Ogasawara Islands with

                            Himeji-jo in Hyogo Prefecture, or the steep thatched roofs of the Historic Villages of
                            Shirakawa-go and Gokayama. The skeletal structure of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial stands as
                            a symbol of peace as well as a stark reminder of an act of atrocity, and towering above them
